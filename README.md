# Biography

Hi, I'm Gerard, an Ivorian-Canadian fullstack developer based in Quebec City since 2012. I specialize in building web applications and have a strong passion for system design. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve how I build software.

With five years of experience in software development, I‚Äôve designed, implemented, and tested solutions that bridge systems and improve interoperability. I value engineering practices like code reviews, unit and integration testing, and I work with DevOps and Agile principles to deliver business value through continuous integration and deployment.

I‚Äôve contributed to the design and deployment of modern architectures (3-tier, pub/sub) in cloud environments with Kubernetes and APIs. My technical background includes REST, gRPC, SOAP, SQL, and NoSQL. I‚Äôm proficient in Go, Python, and JavaScript, and always ready to adapt to new tools and languages as needed.

I‚Äôve also taken on support and Scrum Master roles, helping teams stay focused and aligned. For me, being a team player means building lasting, positive impact wherever I work.

## üî® Projects

### 2022 
#### [Calmo ‚Äì Health Record üîó](https://calmo.gerardseka.com) 
Web application for managing patient records with secure authentication, access control, and medical activity consultation.

##### Use case
The personas `macaron` and `stbakhita` were using the password `Passw0rd.`.

Since macaron was appointed President of Cefran, his security clearance has been raised to a higher level than his doctor, stbakhita.
As a result, stbakhita has no longer access to the information previously entered in macaron‚Äôs health record (see anonymized health record).



### 2018 
#### [Physics Challenge ‚Äì REST API üîó](https://physics-challenge.gerardseka.com/docs)
Interactive REST API offering physics-based challenges. Successfully solving a problem returns a validation FLAG.



### 2016 
#### [Student Enterprise ‚Äì Leadership & Community Impact üîó](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/college-ahuntsic_bravo-%C3%A0-g%C3%A9rard-wilfried-seka-et-eug%C3%A9nie-branchard-activity-6144219928527466496-c9YW/)
